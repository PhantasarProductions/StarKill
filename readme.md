A nice and simple DOS Text Mode classic shooting game.

STAR KILL was meant as a nice challenge for myself to make a good old DOS style character only based game.
It's a simple "endless" arcade game, in which you just need to surive as long as possible.
Move the ship with the mouse and click to shoot.

The game requires DOSBox or another emulator which can emulate old DOS environments.

The game was written in Turbo Pascal 7.0
